ModernCompilerImplementationInJava
==================================

A lot of the source code in the book "Modern Compiler Implementation in Java",
2 ed. by Andrew Appel isn't on the website.  The book says the source code
should be availible at [the course webpage](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/computer-science/programming-languages-and-applied-logic/modern-compiler-implementation-java-2nd-edition), but it's not there as far as I can tell.  I wanted to save others the
trouble of having to type up all the code themselves, so I typed it up and made
this repo so others can access it.  I will be updating this as I make my way
through the book.
